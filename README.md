## Content currently in the game

- Basic spaceship movement, attacks
- Asteroids
- Central star that cooks you alive if you fly into it
- Space station that heals you and refuels boost
- Enemies with reasonably-basic AI (manually-spawned)
- A test planet (non-interactable, but does orbit)

## Things to know before playing

- Game doesn't run well on lower end hardware. Sorry.
- Controls are in the pause menu, you can hit [ESC] to view them. 
- If your mouse keeps moving out of the window (or otherwise starts going crazy), pausing and unpausing should fix it.
- The arrow around your spaceship points towards the nearest space station.
- Running into stuff hurts. Try not to do that.
- There is no automatic fire.
- Enemies do not naturally spawn. You have to press the "summon new enemy" button in the pause menu to spawn one.
- Keep distance from your enemy if possible - the AI makes them prone to suicide-ramming.
